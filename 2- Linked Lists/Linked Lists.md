> [!question] What is the linked lists
> is a data structure where elements, called nodes, are linked together. Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements contiguously in memory; instead, nodes are stored wherever there is free space, making them more flexible for adding or removing elements without needing to shift other elements.

#### **Key Differences Between Linked Lists and Arrays:**

 1. Arrays are a built-in data structure with a fixed size and elements stored contiguously in memory.
 2. Linked Lists are custom-built, with nodes that can be stored non-contiguously and include pointers to the next node.
 3. Linked lists allow for constant time insertion and deletion of nodes without the need to shift other elements, unlike arrays, which require shifting when elements are added or removed.
