#### **Introduction**

· **Data Structures**: Methods to organize and store data efficiently. Examples include arrays and linked lists.

· **Algorithms**: Step-by-step instructions to solve problems or perform tasks using data structures.

#### **Data Structures**

· **Primitive Data Structures**: Basic types provided by programming languages (e.g., integers, characters).

· **Abstract Data Structures**: Built from primitive types to support complex operations (e.g., stacks, queues, trees, graphs).

#### **Algorithms**

· **Definition**: Detailed procedures to solve specific problems or achieve goals.

· **Examples**: Sorting (e.g., Bubble Sort), finding routes (e.g., GPS navigation), and search engines.

#### **Relationship Between Data Structures and Algorithms**

· They work together to efficiently store, retrieve, and manipulate data.

· **Importance**: Choosing the right data structure and algorithm improves program performance and resource usage.

#### **Applications of DSA**

· Used in various software systems such as operating systems, databases, web applications, machine learning, video games, cryptography, and search engines.


#### **Key Terminology**

· **Algorithm**: Step-by-step problem-solving procedure.

· **Data Structure**: Method for organizing data.

· **Time Complexity**: Measure of execution time relative to data size.

· **Space Complexity**: Measure of memory usage relative to data size.

· **Big O Notation**: Describes the performance of an algorithm.

· **Recursion**: Function calling itself.

· **Divide and Conquer**: Solving problems by breaking them into smaller sub-problems.

· **Brute Force**: Trying all possible solutions.
